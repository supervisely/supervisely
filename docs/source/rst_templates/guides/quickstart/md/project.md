## Transforming projects

### Compare and merge projects

### Divide project by classes

### Merge classes to single one in project

### Merge classes from different projects with filtering by given criterion 

### Add/delete background class in project

### Split project to several by given criterion

### Rename classes by given criterion 

### Generate hints 


## Getting a project from an existing one with images or(and) annotation transformation

### Crop

### Instances crop

### Flip

### Resize

### Rotate

### Sliding windows split

### Sliding windows merge

### Split AnyShape classes to strictly defined shapes

### Remove annotations of specified classes

### Deletes annotations less (or greater) than specified size or percentage of image area


## Convert classes shapes

### Convert bitmap to rectangle

### Convert line to polygon

### Convert line to rectangle

### Convert polygon to bitmap

### Convert polygon to rectangle

### Convert all classes to rectangle

### Remove too long, too short lines or lines in range

### Merge bitmap masks to single bitmap

### Split bitmap into few bitmap masks if it contain non-connected components

### Converts all geometry classes to bitmaps

### Approximates vector objects in project: lines and polygons

### Remove connected components smaller than the specified size from bitmap annotations

### Bitwise operations between bitmap annotations


## Convert images by using different filters
